 ## Motivatio
 
 Language is complex -- extremely complex. When learning a new language, simply google translating words or phrases and stringing them together results in a significant loss of context and nuance. Even in your native language, it can be a steep learning curve to familiarize yourself with technical vocabulary words in without a proper understanding of them
 
## Tools

We used JavaScript & HTML for the front-end, Python and the OpenAI API for the back-end, and Python Flask to connect the frontend and backend. For storing and retrieving vocabulary list data, we used SQL Alchemy.
